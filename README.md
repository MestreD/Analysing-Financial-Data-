# Analysing financiaal Data-

In this project, I will create a presentation that showcases a portfolio of stocks, provide diferente financial analysis, ratios, target prices and the weights at which one should invest in each stock depending on risk preference. The purpose of this capstone is to practice accessing and downloading financial data, calculating financial statistics to understand the individual performance of an asset and how groups of assets are related, and how to allocate investments across assets for optimal performance
